        <h1>Academic Aid Lagging Behind Athletic Aid</h1>

        <p>More than half the states in the U.S. spend more on aid to collegiate athletes than they do on the rest of the student body, according to my new analysis of federal data.</p>

        <p>In some cases, athletes get as much as 10 times the aid other students get, the analysis of the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act in comparison to National Science Foundation data found. These numbers in some cases are inflated by states that provide tuition subsidies versus aid money, but even in South Carolina, where they give aid not subsidies athletes get three times the money per athlete than other students get in aid.</p>

    <p>This trend is increasing. Participation in collegiate athletics has only grown slightly since 2003, with an average of about 100 athletes per school for the approximately 2000 schools surveyed. On the other hand, the money spent on athletic aid has gone from just over 1.5 billion to over 4.5 billion since 2003. On top of that, during covid the aid money only went up as many colleges cut sports teams like many of the Olympic sports that were not making revenue. The discrepancy is further exemplified by the fact that 27 states spend less on academics than Maine spends on athletics, and Maine spends the least on athletics.</p>

    <p>This results in more money per athlete. But this does not mean that every sport is making a ton of money or even has enough scholarships to field a full team of athletes on scholarship or getting aid.</p>

    <p>“So, the first thing is when we look at the NCAA Division I level, there are regulations when it comes to the number of scholarships athletically that schools can give,” said <a href="https://falk.syr.edu/people/meluni-david/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Meluni</a>, a professor for the Name, Image, and Likeness class at Syracuse University and someone who works closely with athletics and athletes. “The only three sports that you technically could put a full competitive team on the field court in ice is football, 85, men's basketball, 13, women's basketball, 15, and ice hockey men's and women's, each respectively, 18 scholarships.” </p>

    <p>This means that even with the disproportionate amount of money that is being spent on athletic aid, there is still not enough for all athletes. It may not seem like a huge deal on the surface. However, according to Meluni, there is a practice where schools will stack athletic and academic aid packages to try and get closer to the 100% scholarship for an athlete. If academic scholarships are also being given to athletes, the gap between athletes and students could be larger than the numbers show.</p>

        <p>There is variety in how much each state is spending per athlete and in some states the lower number of athletes means each athlete gets more money. However, one thing that is true in every state is that athletes on average are given more aid than students.</p>

        <p><iframe title="Academic Aid per Student vs Athletic Aid per Athlete" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-kKZav" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kKZav/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1313" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>

        <p>Even South Carolina who provides the most student aid, is giving triple in athletic aid. There are states like Arizona and Utah that give a middle of the road amount of athletic aid, but the disparity is still huge due to lower academic aid spending.</p>

        <p>Solutions are hard to find for this problem because when you talk about messing with college sports the need is presented to make sure athletes are getting aid because not all sports can provide enough scholarships. This raises the question where is all the money going? That question is one that remains a mystery because as it is football pays for many sports to operate, according to Meluni.</p>
